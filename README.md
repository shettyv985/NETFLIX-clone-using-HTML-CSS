# Explanation of HTML code
1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is the Document Type Declaration and specifies the document type and version of HTML being used. In this case, it's HTML5.

2. `<html lang="en">`: This is the opening `<html>` tag, which encloses the entire HTML document. The `lang` attribute indicates that the document is in English.

3. `<head>`: This section contains metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding and page title.

4. `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: This `<meta>` tag defines the character encoding of the document as UTF-8, which is a widely used encoding for text on the web.

5. `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This `<meta>` tag sets the viewport properties for responsive design. It ensures that the page scales properly on various devices.

6. `<title>Netflix</title>`: This sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

7. `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`: This `<link>` tag links an external CSS file named "style.css" to style the HTML content.

8. `<body>`: This is the opening `<body>` tag, which contains the main content of the webpage.

9. `<div class="header">`: This `<div>` tag with the class "header" defines the header section of your webpage.

10. `<nav>`: This is the navigation section within the header.

11. `<img src="./netflix-img/images/logo.png" alt="logo" class="logo">`: This `<img>` tag displays the Netflix logo. The `src` attribute specifies the image source, and `alt` provides alternative text for accessibility. The `class` attribute assigns the class "logo" for styling.

12. `<div>`: This is a `<div>` container within the navigation.

13. `<button class="language-btn">English<img src="./netflix-img/images/down-icon.png" alt="down-icon"></button>`: This `<button>` element is used for language selection and sign-in. It contains both text and an image (down icon).

14. `<div class="header-content">`: This `<div>` encloses the main content of the header section.

15. Various `<h1>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, and `<form>` elements: These are used to structure and display text content within the header.

16. `<div class="features">`: This `<div>` defines the features section of your webpage.

17. Multiple `<div class="row">` elements: These represent individual feature rows, each containing an image and text content.

18. `<div class="faq">`: This `<div>` defines the Frequently Asked Questions section.

19. `<h2>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, and `<div>` elements: These elements structure and display the FAQ content, with questions and answers hidden initially until clicked.

20. `<small>`: This element contains additional text within the FAQ section.

21. Another `<form>` element: This is a second form for email signup, similar to the one in the header.

22. `<div class="footer">`: This `<div>` defines the footer section of your webpage.

23. `<h2>`: This heading displays a contact phone number.

24. Three `<div class="col">` elements: These represent columns within the footer, containing links.

25. `<button class="language-btn">`: This button is similar to the one in the header and is used for language selection.

26. `<p class="cpyr8">Netflix India</p>`: This `<p>` element displays copyright or branding information.

That's a breakdown of my HTML code. It creates the structure and content of your Netflix landing page. CSS is likely used to style the page further based on the class and ID attributes assigned to elements.
